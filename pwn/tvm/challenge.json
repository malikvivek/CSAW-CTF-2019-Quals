The brand new TVM is a fully custom TPM that runs entirely in software.\n\nWe found some documentation about the TVM architechture, but when we looked for the source code all we found was one header file.\n\nNOTE: The goal is NOT to get a shell. This is also a crypto challenge.\n\nAuthors: krx & tulipszs\n\n\n\nWe'd love to hear from you if you solve the challenge! Feel free to send an email to team+&lt;flag&gt;@riverloopsecurity.com\n\n`nc {{.Netloc}} {{.DescPort}}`\n\nWE HAVE UPDATED THE PDF! Please download it again.",
