__Synopsis__: _We are a super legitimate crypto company asking you to complete an audit on our new elliptic curve, SuperCurve, in order to show those hecklers at WhiteHat how legit we are!

CTF Challenge for bruteforcing the ECDLP of a basic (and weak) ECC curve with small parameters. The attacker ideally would want to use the baby-giant steps approach for this challenge, or even the Pollard's Rho method.

## Setup

Run `server.py` and listen for connections. User input passed determines whether or not flag should be outputted.
